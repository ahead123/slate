# Introduction

Welcome to the SteelHouse Pixel Mapping Framework.

Our mappings are all written in, the popular JavaScript language! 
The documentation is setup with some explanation's on the left
and code examples on the right. 

Code can also be copied from the text editor on the right
and used inside the SteelHouse Pixel Dashboard.

```javascript

// example
steelHouseMappings = ( message = "devOps") => { 
		console.log("We are the SteelHouse "+ message + " team!" )
}

```
