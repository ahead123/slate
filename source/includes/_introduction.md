# Introduction

Welcome to the SteelHouse Pixel Mapping Framework.

Our mappings are all written in, the popular JavaScript language! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right!

```javascript

// example
steelHouseMappings = ( message = "devOps") => { 
		console.log("We are the SteelHouse "+ message + " team!" )
}

```
